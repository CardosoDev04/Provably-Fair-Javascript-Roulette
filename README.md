# Provably-Fair-Javascript-Roulette
This is a simple horizontal roulette spinner, in which the outcome is randomly generated by a Provably Fair system using client and server seeds and SHA-256 encryption. The visual part of the roulette was forked from another user listed in the license part of this software.  If you have any questions add me on Discord: CardosoDev#5775
